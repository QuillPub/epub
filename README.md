A library for reading, ~~writing, and modifying~~ epub3 files. The other parts will come later.

While working on Quill, we discovered that there are no good libraries for reading and writing epub files in go. So this library aspires to let you read and write epubs using go. The first thing we need is reading metadata, so that's where we are right now. Expect more functionality as Quill's needs expand.
